Birthday Bot uses **time zones** to detect when to celebrate each user's birthday. If you are unsure of your time zone you can find it [here](faq.md#i-cant-find-my-time-zone).

Now, you can then reply to this message with your desired time zone.

Birthday Bot will now know your time zone and will use this to know when to celebrate your birthday!

Now, Birthday Bot will prompt you to put your Birth Month & Date in the following format: MM/DD

Each user only has a limited amount of Birthday Sets. These multiple sets are made to account for incorrect information input, time zone changes, etc.
