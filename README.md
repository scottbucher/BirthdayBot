### Support and Troubleshooting

Birthday Bot is a part of the Arilyn Bot family, and any support, questions, or feedback are welcome in our support [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/39w2cnBRa2). Please visit our [FAQ](https://birthdaybot.scottbucher.dev/faq) and setup guide, as well as previous user questions, before contacting staff. Thanks!

**Example Birthday Announcement (Fully customizable):**

![Example Birthday Announcement](https://birthday-bot-docs-images.s3.amazonaws.com/example-birthday-message.gif)

In your Discord server Birthday Bot will track your users' birthdays and using their time zone celebrate their birthday through its customizable birthday role and message. Even if you have a large discord, use Birthday Bots trusted-role system to only celebrate the users you want to avoid the spam of tracking everyone. Similar messages can also be setup to celebrate the anniversary of members joining your discord server and the anniversary of the server itself!

## Setting your birthday

Birthday Bot makes everything easy using an easy-to-follow process.

Start by using `/set`.

![Default time zone prompt](https://birthday-bot-docs-images.s3.amazonaws.com/1-Set+command+with+default+time+zone+prompt.png)

If your server has a default time zone set you will be asked if you would like to use that time zone. If you do, simply press the check mark, if not choose the x.

Birthday Bot uses time zones to detect when to celebrate each user's birthday. If you are unsure of your time zone you can find it [here](https://github.com/scottbucher/BirthdayBot/blob/master/README.md#finding-your-time-zone).

If you chose the x or your server does not have a default time zone set you will recieve another prompt asking for your time zone

![Time zone input](https://birthday-bot-docs-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2-birthday+bot+time+zone+set+up+in+set+command.png)

Please press the "Enter Response" button and you will see a text input modal like the one below

![Time zone input Modal](https://birthday-bot-docs-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3-time+zone+input+modal.png)

In the text box please enter your time zone and click submit.

Birthday Bot will now know your time zone and will use this to know what time to celebrate your birthday!

Now, Birthday Bot will prompt you to put your Birth Month & Date as well as the option to add your birth year.

![Birthday prompt](https://birthday-bot-docs-images.s3.amazonaws.com/4-birthday+input+prompt.png)

Simply click the "Enter response" button as you did for adding your time zone.

![Birthday input modal](https://birthday-bot-docs-images.s3.amazonaws.com/5-birthday+input+modal.png)

Simply enter your birth month and day along with your birth year if you want (it is not required) and click submit.

Finally, the confirmation menu will appear.

![Confirmation](https://birthday-bot-docs-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6-birthday+save+confirmation.png)

Ensure this is the correct information, then confirm by clicking the checkmark.

![End](https://birthday-bot-docs-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7-birthday+set+success+message.png)

For users that is it! Server owners will have to do a bit more but Birthday Bot makes it easy with an interactive setup. For more information on server setup follow our guide here.

As the message states birth years are hidden in all servers by default. Learn more about Birthday Bot's user privacy settings [here](https://birthdaybot.scottbucher.dev/faq-1/user/user-privacy).

## Finding your time zone

[Kevin Novak](https://github.com/KevinNovak) has created a handy [map time zone picker](https://kevinnovak.github.io/Time-Zone-Picker/)!

Simply click your location on the map and copy the name of the selected time zone. You can then use it in the `/set` command.
