In your Discord server Birthday Bot will track your users' birthdays and using their time zone celebrate their birthday through its customizable birthday role and message. Even if you have a large discord, use Birthday Bots trusted-role system to only celebrate the users you want to avoid the spam of tracking everyone.

## Setting your birthday

Enter your birthday by typing `bday set` and following the prompts.

Birthday Bot will then know your time zone and will use this to know when to celebrate your birthday.

## Finding your time zone

[Kevin Novak](https://github.com/KevinNovak) has created a handy [map time zone picker](https://kevinnovak.github.io/Time-Zone-Picker/)!

Simply click your location on the map and copy the name of the selected time zone. You can then use it in the `bday set` command.'
