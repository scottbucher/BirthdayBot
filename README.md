Birthday Bot will now know your time zone and will use this to know what time to celebrate your birthday!

Now, Birthday Bot will prompt you to put your Birth Month & Date in the following format: MM/DD

For users that is it! Server owners will have to do a bit more but Birthday Bot makes it easy with an interactive setup. For more information on server setup follow our guide here.

## Finding your time zone

[Kevin Novak](https://github.com/KevinNovak) has created a handy [map time zone picker](https://kevinnovak.github.io/Time-Zone-Picker/)!

Simply click your location on the map and copy the name of the selected time zone. You can then use it in the `bday set` command.
