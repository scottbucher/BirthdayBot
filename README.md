In your Discord server Birthday Bot will track your users' birthdays and using their time zone celebrate their birthday through its customizable birthday role and message. Even if you have a large discord, use Birthday Bots trusted-role system to only celebrate the users you want to avoid the spam of tracking everyone.

## Quick Start Guide

Start by typing `bday set`.

### Finding Your Time Zone

[Kevin Novak](https://github.com/KevinNovak) has created a handy [map time zone picker](https://kevinnovak.github.io/Time-Zone-Picker/)!

Simply click your location on the map and copy the name of the selected time zone. You can then use it in the `bday set` command.'

Birthday Bot will then know your time zone and will use this to know when to celebrate your birthday.

Full example usage of `bday set`:

For users that's it! Server owners will have to do a bit more but Birthday Bot makes it easy with the interactive setup commands `bday setup`, `bday setup message`, and `bday setup trusted`!
