In your Discord server Birthday Bot will track your users' birthdays and using their time zone celebrate their birthday through its customizable birthday role and message. Even if you have a large discord, use Birthday Bots trusted-role system to only celebrate the users you want to avoid the spam of tracking everyone.

## Quick Start Guide

Start by typing `bday set`.

### Finding Your Time Zone

[Keval Bhatt](https://github.com/kevalbhatt) has created a handy map time zone picker:

<http://kevalbhatt.github.io/timezone-picker/>

Simply click your location on the map, and use the name displayed in the dropdown box as your time zone.

You can then take your time zone name and use it in the `bday set` command.

Birthday Bot will then know your time zone and will use this to know when to celebrate your birthday.
