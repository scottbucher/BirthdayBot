In your Discord server Birthday Bot will track your users' birthdays and using their time zone celebrate their birthday through its customizable birthday role and message. Even if you have a large discord, use Birthday Bots trusted-role system to only celebrate the users you want to avoid the spam of tracking everyone. Similar messages can also be setup to celebrate the anniversary of members joining your discord server and the anniversary of the server itself!

## Setting your birthday

Birthday Bot makes everything easy using an easily to follow process.

Start by using `bday set`.

Birthday Bot uses time zones to detect when to celebrate each user's birthday. If you are unsure of your time zone you can find it [here](https://github.com/scottbucher/BirthdayBot/blob/master/README.md#finding-your-time-zone).

Now, you can then reply to this message with your desired time zone.

Birthday Bot will now know your time zone and will use this to know what time to celebrate your birthday!

Now, Birthday Bot will prompt you to put your Birth Month & Date in the following format: MM/DD

For users that is it! Server owners will have to do a bit more but Birthday Bot makes it easy with an interactive setup. For more information on server setup follow our guide here.

## Finding your time zone

Simply click your location on the map and copy the name of the selected time zone. You can then use it in the `bday set` command.
